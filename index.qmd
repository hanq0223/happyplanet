# Introduction

The Happy Planet Index is a measure of sustainable wellbeing, evaluating countries by how efficiently they deliver long, happy lives for their residents using our limited environmental resources. It provides an approach to assess countries' achievements by investigating factors that contribute to human wellbeing other than traditional economic indicators. By analyzing regions, population, life expectancy, carbon emission, and GDP, HPI highlights what truly matters to our wellbeing in terms of long, happy, and meaningful lives. Our project aims to uncover patterns and relationships between these variables, and help find a balance between wellbeing, resource consumption, and material circumstances. Through this analysis, we will share deeper insights for global happiness.
