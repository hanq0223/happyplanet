    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe Happy Planet Index is a measure of sustainable well-being, evaluating countries by how efficiently they deliver long, happy lives for their residents using our limited environmental resources. HPI is designed to highlight the importance of sustainability and equity. It provides an approach to assess countries’ achievements by investigating factors that contribute to human well-being other than traditional economic indicators. By analyzing regions, population, life expectancy, carbon emission, and GDP, HPI highlights what truly matters to our well-being in terms of long, happy, and meaningful lives. Our project aims to uncover patterns and relationships between these variables, and help find a balance between well-being, resource consumption, and material circumstances. Through this analysis, we will share deeper insights for global happiness.",

    "text": "2.1\n# 2.1\nThe data set selected is from the Happy Planet Index (HPI) provided by HotorCool, ranking countries based on their HPI score, using 2021 data with the latest rankings available for 2024. It includes columns HPI rank, Country, ISO, Continent, Population, Life Expectancy, Ladder of Life (Wellbeing), Carbon Footprint, CO2 threshold, GDP per capita, and HPI. Life Expectancy data is sourced from the UN Population Division’s World Population Prospects 2022, updated periodically based on demographic projections. Ladder of Life scores are collected annually by Gallup World Poll through surveys of around 1,000 individuals per country, asking respondents to rate their life satisfaction on a scale of 0 to 10, with results weighted to match national demographics. Carbon Footprint data is taken from the World Inequality Database, providing per capita estimates based on national accounts, and GDP per capita comes from global financial institutions like the World Bank. Some missing values are imputed using adjacent years, creating uncertainty, while survey sampling limitations and time lags in the 2024 rankings (based on 2021 data) may affect accuracy.\nThe data set is provided in a excel format. We save the data sheet as a csv file and import it using read_csv.\n# 2.2\nCode\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nhpi_2024 &lt;- read_csv(\" All countries_20211.csv\", skip=8)\n\n\nNew names:\n• `` -&gt; `...4`\n\n\nRows: 149 Columns: 12\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): Country, ISO, ...4\ndbl (9): HPI rank, Continent, Population (thousands), Life Expectancy (years...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\nCode\nmissing_values &lt;- colSums(is.na(hpi_2024))\nbar_plot &lt;- ggplot(data.frame(Column = names(missing_values), Missing = missing_values), \n                   aes(x = Column, y = Missing, fill = Column)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", color = \"black\") +\n  labs(title = \"Count of Missing Values per Column\", x = \"Columns\", y = \"Count of Missing Values\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + # Tilt x-axis labels\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set3\")\nbar_plot\nThe data does not exhibit any obvious missing values. However, as mentioned in the HPI 2024 methodology report, some missing values may have been imputed using data from adjacent years.\nCode\nhpi_2024$IsMissing &lt;- ifelse(hpi_2024$`Ladder of life (Wellbeing) (0-10)` == 0, \"0\", \"Other Values\")\n\nmissing_plot &lt;- ggplot(hpi_2024, aes(x = IsMissing, fill = IsMissing)) + geom_bar(color = \"black\") + scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Missing (0)\" = \"pink\", \"Other Values\" = \"lightblue\")) + labs(title = \"Distribution of Missing (0) vs Other Values\", x = \"Value Type\", y = \"Count\") + theme_minimal()\n\nprint(missing_plot)\nHowever, there are 0 values in the HPI scores and the Ladder of Life columns, which may indicate missing data in the Ladder of Life scores. Based on the calculation methodology for the HPI score, a 0 in the HPI score might be directly influenced by a 0 in the Ladder of Life column. Therefore, we analyze the number of 0 values in the Ladder of Life column to observe the potential missing values. We can see that there are only two 0 scores for Ladder of Life columns, which are for Sudan and Burundi.",
